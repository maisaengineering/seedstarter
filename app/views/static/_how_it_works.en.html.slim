|Seedstarter is a website dedicated to crowdfunding science research projects that have the potential to help create a better tomorrow. Submit your project and tell us what you are doing, how much you need and what your deadline is. People can opt to back your project starting from A$10, and receive rewards based on your particular research project. If you reach your funding target by the cutoff date, your project will be funded. Otherwise, each backer will receive their money back.
